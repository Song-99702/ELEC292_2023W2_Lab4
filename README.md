For this module, you will design, build, program, and test a microcontroller-based
photoelectric heart rate monitor. This kind of heart monitor is attached to a patient finger
to measure the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). The device you will be building is
based on a non-invasive photo transmitter/receiver pair sensor which detects small
variations of blood flow in the fingers due to the heart pumping action. After filtering
and amplifying such variations, a microcontroller-useable signal can be generated. By
measuring the period or frequency of such signal, the heart rate of the person using the
sensor can be determined.
In this module you will be programming the EFM8LB1 microcontroller using the
C programming language. C is the de facto standard for the programming of embedded
systems. The EFM8LB1 is the microcontroller used in the EFM8 board you assembled
for project 1.
